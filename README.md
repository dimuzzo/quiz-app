Welcome to the SAS Quiz application! This is a web app designed to test your knowledge of Sviluppo Applicazioni Software (the app is currently only in Italian).

---

## 🌟 Overview

The application offers two main quiz modes:

1.  **Theory Quiz:** True/false questions to verify understanding of fundamental software application development concepts and the Unified Process.
2.  **Design Patterns Quiz:** Multiple-choice questions focused on GRASP and GoF design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral), with problem-solution scenarios and UML diagram interpretation.

Both quizzes provide immediate feedback with detailed explanations for each answer and a final screen summarizing the statistics.
